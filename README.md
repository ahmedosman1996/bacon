## Development üõ†Ô∏è

This app is built using `react-native`, make sure to have it setup to get started. Currently only Android is supported.

This uses [react-native-ble-manager](https://github.com/innoveit/react-native-ble-manager) internally to handle BLE connection.

Note: Support for iOS would come after polishing essential features of the App. However, testers/contributors are still welcome.
